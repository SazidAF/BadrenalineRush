How To Play
You are a guy with anger issues and soft spot for animals. So, when you see a bunch of kids locking up bunnies for fun, you become a bad guy. Now you are popping balloons (E) to upset kids which gives you a Badrenaline Energy that you can use to break cages (E) to free bunnies or double Jump (Double Space). Press A/D to move left or right and space to jump.
